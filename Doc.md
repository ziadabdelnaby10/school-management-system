**School Management System Documentation**  
**System Name:** School Management System  
**Technology Stack:** Spring Boot, JPA, MySQL  

---

### **1. System Overview**  
A comprehensive system to manage school operations including student enrollment, teacher management, academic records,
grading, and guardian interactions.
Built with Spring Boot for rapid development and JPA for efficient database interactions.
---

### **2. Database Schema Overview**  
#### **Key Tables**  
- **Staff Management:** `staff`, `staff_positions`, `marital_status`  
- **Student Management:** `students`, `guardians`, `guardian_type`  
- **Academic Structure:** `academic_year`, `term`, `subjects`, `classes`  
- **Grading:** `grades`, `results`  
- **Lookup Tables:** `genders`, `marital_status`  

#### **Triggers**  
- Auto-generate IDs (e.g., `staff_id`, `student_id`).  
- Update counters (e.g., `num_students` in classes).  
- Email generation for staff/students.  

---

### **3. Use Cases**  
#### **Actors**  
1. **Admin**  
   - Manage staff positions and roles.  
   - Create academic years and terms.  
   - Assign form teachers to classes.  

2. **Teacher**  
   - Input student grades.  
   - View assigned classes and subjects.  

3. **Student**  
   - View academic results.  
   - Update personal details.  

4. **Guardian**  
   - Access student progress reports.  
   - Communicate with teachers.  

#### **Key Scenarios**  
- **Enrollment:** A guardian registers a student, who is assigned to a class.  
- **Grading:** A teacher enters test/exam scores, triggering grade calculations.  
- **Promotion:** At year-end, students advance to the next class.

### **4. Stakeholders**  
| Stakeholder         | Interest/Requirement                                                                 |  
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **School Admin**     | Manage staff, classes, and academic calendars.                                       |  
| **Teachers**         | Track student performance and submit grades efficiently.                             |  
| **Students**         | Access timetables, results, and personal data.                                       |  
| **Parents/Guardians**| Monitor academic progress and communicate with teachers.                             |  
| **IT Team**          | Ensure system reliability, security, and scalability.                                |

### **5. Advanced Feature Suggestions**  
#### **A. Feature Enhancements**  
1. **Attendance Tracking**  
   - Add `attendance` table with `student_id`, `date`, `status` (Present/Absent).  
   - Integrate biometric/QR code check-ins.  

2. **Fee Management**  
   - Tables: `fee_structure`, `payments`, `invoices`.  
   - Automate reminders for overdue fees.  

3. **Library Module**  
   - Track books, borrowers, and due dates.  

4. **Communication Portal**  
   - Notify guardians via SMS/email about grades, events, or fees.  

5. **Reporting & Analytics**  
   - Generate PDF reports for report cards or financial summaries.  
   - Dashboard for visualizing student performance trends.  

#### **B. Technical Improvements**  
1. **Security**  
   - Integrate Spring Security with OAuth2/JWT for role-based access.  
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., emails, phone numbers).  

2. **APIs**  
   - RESTful endpoints for:  
     - `GET /api/students/{id}/results`  
     - `POST /api/staff/assign-subject`  

3. **Performance**  
   - Add indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `student_id`).  
   - Use Hibernate second-level caching.  

4. **Audit Logging**  
   - Track changes to critical tables (e.g., `results`, `students`) via `audit_log`.  

---

### **6. Potential Schema Improvements**  
1. **Student/Staff IDs**  
   - Replace trigger-generated IDs with UUIDs or auto-increment to avoid collisions.  

2. **Result Date Handling**  
   - Uncomment the `result_date` trigger to auto-capture entry timestamps.  

3. **Normalization**  
   - Split `subjects` into `core_subjects` and `elective_subjects`.  

4. **Constraints**  
   - Add `CHECK` constraints (e.g., `academic_year.start_date < end_date`).  

---

### **7. Deployment & Extensions**  
- **Containerization:** Dockerize the Spring Boot app and MySQL.  
- **AI Integration:** Predict student performance using historical data.  
- **Mobile App:** Develop a companion app for parents and students.  

---

### **8. Appendix: Sample API Endpoints**  
```java
// StudentController.java  
@GetMapping("/students/{id}/results")  
public ResponseEntity<List<Result>> getStudentResults(@PathVariable Integer id) { ... }  

// StaffController.java  
@PostMapping("/staff/assign-subject")  
public ResponseEntity<String> assignSubject(@RequestBody SubjectAssignmentDTO dto) { ... }  
```

**Next Steps:**  
1. Implement advanced modules (attendance, fees).  
2. Add authentication/authorization.  
3. Optimize database queries with indexing.
